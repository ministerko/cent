# Cent Remixer üéâ

## Overview

On Innovation Day, we created an exciting project that fetches song lyrics, passes them to an AI model for remixing, and displays the remixed lyrics on the UI. This project utilizes FastAPI, the Lyrics.ovh API, and the Gemma:2b model hosted on a local machine.

## Features

- üé∂ **Fetch Song Lyrics:** Retrieve song lyrics from the Lyrics.ovh API.
- ü§ñ **AI Remix:** Use the Gemma:2b model to remix the fetched lyrics.
- üíª **User Interface:** Display the remixed lyrics on the UI.

## How It Works

1. **Fetch Lyrics:**
   - The program uses the Lyrics.ovh API to fetch the lyrics of a specified song.

2. **Remix Lyrics:**
   - The fetched lyrics are sent to the Gemma:2b model, which is hosted locally.
   - The model processes the lyrics and generates a remixed version.

3. **Display Remixed Lyrics:**
   - The remixed lyrics are returned and displayed on the UI.
